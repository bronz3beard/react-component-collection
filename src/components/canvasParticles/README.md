The is a canvas which randomly paints particles and can be used as an animated background for example the background for a from element.

If you would like to change the shape of the particles from `circles` to `squares` uncomment `line: 110` and then comment out `line: 101`

To change how long a particle is painted on the canvas change `line: 68`

To change colour of particles edit `line: 96`

Particle transparency controlled on `line: 96` or `line: 106`
